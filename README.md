# Machine_learning-_trading_bot

This repository is to create and tries to optimize a trading algorithmic  machine learning model to automate the trading decisions. first step is to create a base line model that is based on Support Vector Machines and then it is been optimize by adjusting input parameters, training size. Lastly, Appling new machine learning model to compare and evaluate better performing model.

## Establishing a Baseline Performance

Purpose - The purpose of baseline model(SVM) is to identify the technical signals to make trading decision. If actual returns on close price are more than 0 the model suggests to buy shares that is to go long strategy. Where as if the actual return is less than 0 it signals to go short sell. 

Input features - 4 days short-window SMA  and 100 dys long-window SMA

Traning Period - 3 months

## Conclusion 

The baseline model worked well on finding the signals for long strategy that is to buy shares. Where as it didnâ€™t perform great in finding signals for short sell. The Accuracy just went above 50%. Also, it might go in overfitting if it is used on unseen data. So the model need further tunning or considering a different model to predict short sell signal as well.

After trying on tunning the model by adjusting the SMA Windows, helped a little to get more signals for short sell but signals for buy stock went down to 81%. The model improved for short sell signals as compared to baseline model.

Next, try was to increase the training period to 6 months, showed some improvement in short sell signal but the buy signal suffered furthermore. Precision and accuracy stated same. 

Finally, applying different models results into same precision for all three models. Logistic Regression model was better at finding sell signals. Decision tree was opposite of baseline model that is great at finding sell short signals. AdaBoost was similar to baseline model. So overall model still needs to be optimized to perform well.
